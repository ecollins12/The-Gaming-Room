The Gaming Room Software Design Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room is a video game company that has already created a game but wants the game to be developed as a web-based app so that it can run on mobile platforms and support multiplayer.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I did well with creating the design constraints. I found it challenging to translate requirements into design constraints, but I have found a lot of value in learning how to properly explain design constraints. I have even been able to carry this into my real-life job in designing a Market Requirements Document for an API app.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- I find Domain Models invaluable when putting an idea for a program into code. Having an accurate UML diagram prepared makes designing code so much easier.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- Based on my grade and personal reflection I would revise the recommendations section. I focused too much on explaining systems in general rather than explaining why I chose a certain system.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- When designing an application that a user will be interacting with, it's important to think of use-case scenarios. Your user will likely need specific instructions in order to operate the software. With an application like this we are able to take the design constraints and design a user experience that meets all of the user needs.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- Designing software is all about preparation and organization. This course emphasized choosing the best tools for the job. When met with a project like this I do my best to organize everything in order to design the software properly with UML diagrams, data flows, object-oriented design, etc. Since I began learning about developing, approaching a project has been a scary thing because I don’t know where to start. In the future I hope to learn even more techniques for planning software design to help arrange my plan in order to execute without having to do any guess work.
